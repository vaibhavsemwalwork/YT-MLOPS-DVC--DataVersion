1. create a git repo and clone it in local
2. creade mycode.py and add code to it. (it will save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before initializing dvc. 
4. install dvc "pip install dvc"
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3"
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: (```git rm -r --cached "data"``` and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
